- 👋 Hi, I’m Nick Cowoski
- 👀 I’m interested in video games, cooking and cats!
- 🌱 I’m currently in a 14 week coding boot camp learning C#/.NET, HTML, CSS and SQL. Outside of the camp's curriculum I've started
to dabble in Unity game engine and planning to work more in that space.
- 💞️ I’m currently working on a Rogue-like RPG game and hope to have a development alpha made by the end of 2021!
